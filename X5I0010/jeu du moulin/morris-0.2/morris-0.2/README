  Morris
 --------
  A computer implementation of Nine Men's Morris and its variants.

======================================================================

OVERVIEW

  Morris is an implementation of the board game "Nine Men's Morris".
  Sometimes simply called Mills, Morris, Merrills, or MÃ¼hle in German.
  The implementation supports not only the standard game, but also
  several rule-variants and different boards.

  Furthermore, the game supports:
  -- a strong computer AI player
  -- advanced AI controls to tweak AI playing style
  -- giving hints for good moves
  -- showing the principal variation
  -- move takeback (undo and redo)
  -- internationalization
  -- many board and rule variations 
  -- configurable display


AI ALGORITHM

  The AI algorithm is a standard alpha-beta search in a NegaMax
  implementation using iterative deepening. It employs a
  transposition table to quickly find previously computed positions.

  A special feature is the automatic learning capability: whenever
  the computer wins or loses a game, it will prefer to obtain or
  avoid similar situations in the future. This results in a better
  long-term motivation, since the computer will not make the same
  mistake twice and the gameplay will be more randomized.

  The evaluation function consists of four parts:
  - material: the number of pieces each player has left
  - freedom: the number of possible moves a player can conduct
  - mills: the number of closed mills
  - experience: the learning-bias from previous games
